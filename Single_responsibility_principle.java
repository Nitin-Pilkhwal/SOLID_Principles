// The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. It states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have a single responsibility or purpose.

// In your code snippet, the class Single_responsibility_principle is empty, so it doesn't have any specific responsibilities or behaviors. However, I can provide an example to demonstrate the Single Responsibility Principle.

// Let's say we have a class called Employee that represents an employee in a company. The Employee class should have a single responsibility, such as managing employee information. Here's an example implementation:

class Employee {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String department;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters

    public void saveEmployeeInformation() {
        // Code to save employee information to a database
    }

    public void calculateSalary() {
        // Code to calculate the employee's salary
    }

    public void printEmployeeReport() {
        // Code to generate and print an employee report
    }
}

// In this example, the Employee class has three methods: saveEmployeeInformation(), calculateSalary(), and printEmployeeReport(). Each method represents a specific responsibility related to managing employee information. The class follows the Single Responsibility Principle because it has a single reason to change: if there are changes in how employee information is saved, salary is calculated, or reports are generated.

// By adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, we can achieve code that is more maintainable, modular, and easier to understand. Each class has a clear purpose, making it easier to modify or extend without affecting unrelated parts of the code.

public class Single_responsibility_principle {
    
}
